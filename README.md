# IBM Workshop: Future Sales Prediction

This challenge was done in occasion of a workshop held by IBM at MIP Politecnico di Milano and is taken from Kaggle challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales).

In this competition, I worked with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. The task is to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month.
